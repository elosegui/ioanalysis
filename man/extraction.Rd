\title{
Implements Extraction Method
}
\description{
Applies the Extraction method as outlined in Dietzenbacher et al. (1993)
}
\usage{
extraction(mip, X, f, v, forward=FALSE, write.xlsx=FALSE, name="Extraction.xlsx")
}

\arguments{
  \item{mip}{Matrix. Input output matrix}
  \item{X}{Vector. Input in each column}
  \item{f}{Vector. Final demand vector}
  \item{v}{Vector. Primary input vector}
  \item{write.xlsx}{Logical. If TRUE writes an excel file}
  \item{name}{String. Name of the excel file}
}
\details{
The matrix should be read cautiously. Columns indicate the sector under analysis. So the first column gives the impact when sector 1 is hypthetically extracted from the system. Thus A[1,1] is the impact to sector 1 when that sector is hypothetically extracted. A[1,2] gives the impact to sector 1 when sector 2 was hypothetically extracted.
A[2,1] represents the impact on sector 2 when sector 1 is hypothetically extracted and so on.

The diagonal of the output matrix represents Dietzenbacher's feedback effect.
}
\value{
Returns a matrix with the Extraction matrix
